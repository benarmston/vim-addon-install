This is a short script I wrote to automate the installation
of vim addons from the vim.org website. Use it as follows:
    ./vim-addon-install.sh $PLUGIN_NAME
to install the plugin $PLUGIN_NAME.

This script definitely works with .vim files, and works with
tar.gz and .zip files that are created such that they can
be unpacked in the .vim directory. If the .vim file is specified
as a color scheme on vim.org, then it is automatically
installed to the colors folder.

This script is still experimental, so use with discretion.
